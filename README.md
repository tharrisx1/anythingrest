anythingrest
============

Anything Rest is a framework for taking a Hibernate model and exposing it via a set of RESTful CRUD APIs. Out of the box, it supports standard CRUD and retrieval by name/value pairs. Extension to provide more specific retrieval queries or more complex operations is very easily done by extending BeanBehaviors.

See the Anything Rest Example project for a simple example of how the various components are used. This project is certainly a WIP and I welcome feature/bug input as well as pull requests.
